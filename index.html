    <p>Hello, my name is Karen Nguyen and I am currently a senior Media and Information major at
        Michigan State University. I am a full time student and a part time employee at Fresh Thyme
        Farmers Market.

    <h2 id="subtitles">Biography</h2>
    <p>Growing up in Kentwood, Michigan, I had my mom, dad, and older sister by my side. From a young age, I fell in love with
        the sound of music. After years of hearing my sister play the piano, I begged my parents to let me learn.
        At the age of 7, I started taking lessons, taking standardized tests every year to move on to the next level, and even
        went to some competitions throughout the years. This boosted my pure love for music. When I moved onto middle school,
        I also took on the flute, which then moved me to marching band in high school. In high school, I joined the golf
        team and made lifelong friends.
    </p>

    <h2 id="subtitles">On the Way to College</h2>
    <p>As college approached, I had to really start thinking about what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. I always
        knew that I loved computers, but I wasn't sure what to do with it. Senior year of high school, I took a coding class
        as an elective and realized that I had a lot of fun doing it. Not only did I have fun, but I was amazed with how
        organized it could look if it was done right. This was the tipping point for me, because I am a fool for organization.
    </p>
    
    <h2 id="subtitles">In College</h2>
    <p>Heading to college, the only major that I was aware of that used coding was computer science engineering, so that was the
        major I came in with. After taking the classes for a couple of years, I realized that I stopped having fun with it.
        It was no longer satisfying to me. It was stressing me out and I never had the chance to make my own style. This was when I
        found media and information. Media and information incorporates coding, allows me to put my own spin on things, and
        is overall just a better fit for what I want and love to do.
